<h1>Druidic Circle of the City </h1>
<h3>Within every city is the same air that lows through forests and above seas. All manner of lora and fauna call the streets, sewers, and rooftops their home; rats tunnel through walls, creeping moss blankets brick, birds lay nests, and bugs infest every corner. Pockets of nature endure nestled within civilization, and where nature goes, druids follow. Druids of the Circle of the City embody nature's quietp ersistence, preferring a subtle hand and quick eye in defense of their small, hidden sanctuaries. </h3>
