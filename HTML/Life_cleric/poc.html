<title>Pendant Of Courage</title>
<h1>Pendant Of Courage</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Uncommon</h4>
<h3>
    This pendant is made of a vibrantly colored Emerald, encased with a shining, reflective case made of silver. If the
    emerald is removed from the case, both it and the case disappear. It is attached to a wire which forms the pendant.
    Once per day, a creature may use an action to hold the emerald above their head and speak the Pendant's command
    word. Upon using it, the creature gains the effects of the heroism spell for 5 minutes and has their Strength and
    Constitution scores increase by 2 for 1 minute. The temporary hp gained from the spell is 1d8 instead of
    spellcasting ability. While the pendants of Wisdom, Courage and Power are all within 15 feet of each other, an oddly
    familiar tune can be heard by anyone within 30 feet of any of the 3 pendants. Magical silence has no effect on the
    tune's playing.
