<title>Pendant Of Wisdom</title>
<h1>Pendant Of Wisdom</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Uncommon</h4>
<h3>
This pendant is made of a vibrantly colored Ruby, encased with a shining, reflective case of silver. If the ruby is removed from the case, both it and the case disappear. It is attached to a wire which forms the pendant. Once per day, a creature may use an action to hold the ruby above their head and speak the Pendant's command word. Upon using it, the creature can cast sending one time using no material components and no spell slots. If the spell is not cast within one minute, this ability is wasted. The creature's Wisdom score is increased by 2 and also has advantage on its next Wisdom saving throw or check. While the pendants of Wisdom, Courage and Power are all within 15 feet of each other, an oddly familiar tune can be heard by anyone within 30 feet of any of the 3 pendants. Magical silence has no effect on the tune's playing.
