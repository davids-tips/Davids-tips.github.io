<title>Pendant Of Power</title>
<h1>Pendant Of Power</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Uncommon</h4>
<h3>
This pendant is made of a vibrantly colored Sapphire, encased with a shining, reflective case made of silver. If the sapphire is removed from the case, both it and the case disappear. It is attached to a wire which forms the pendant. Once per day, a creature may use an action to hold the sapphire above their head and speak the Pendant's command word. Upon using it, a creature can cast a total of 3 cantrips (any cantrip is valid) and all of their ability scores are increased by one for 5 minutes. If the cantrips are not cast within 8 hours, the ability is wasted. While the pendants of Wisdom, Courage and Power are all within 15 feet of each other, an oddly familiar tune can be heard by anyone within 30 feet of any of the 3 pendants. Magical silence has no effect on the tune's playing.
