  <title>Ring of Elemental Water</title>
  <h1>Ring of Elemental Water</h1>
  <h4>Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</h4>
  <h2>Attunment Benefits</h2>
  <h3>While attuned to this ring, you gain the following benefits:</h3>
  <ul>◾
    You gain resistance to cold damage
  </ul>
  <ul>◾
    You can breathe underwater
  </ul>
  <ul>◾
    You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed
  </ul>
  <ul>◾
    You become naturally acclimated to extreme cold environments and frigid
    water, succeeding automatically on saving throws to avoid exhaustion due to
    exposure to such environments.
  </ul>
  <ul>◾
    You can use a bonus action to cause a powerful burst of water to erupt from
    the ring and strike the creature when you hit a creature with a melee weapon
    attack on your turn. If the creature is large or smaller, you can either
    push it back 10 feet or knock it prone. If the creature is huge or larger,
    it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet.
    Once you use this property of the ring, it cannot be used again until you
    have completed a short or long rest.
  </ul>
  <ul>◾
    As an action, you can cause the ring to create a steady flow of fresh, clean
    water. You can create up to 5 gallons of water daily with this ability.
  </ul>
