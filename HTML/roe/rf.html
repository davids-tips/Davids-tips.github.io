<title>Ring of Elemental Fey</title>
<h1>Ring of Elemental Fey</h1>
<h4>Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</h4>

<h3>Attunement to the potent faerie magic of the Feywild causes your facial features to change slightly to more
    closely resemble a fey creature. Your eyes become slightly brighter and your ears become slightly longer. While
    attuned to this ring, you gain the following benefits:</h3>
<ul>◾
    You can cast the cantrip dancing lights as an action. Your
    spellcasting ability for this spell is Charisma.</ul>
<ul>◾
    You gain advantage on saving throws against being
    charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. If you already
    possess the Fey
    trait, you become immune to
    being charmed.
</ul>
<ul>◾
    Due to your connection to the time-warping qualities of
    the Feywild, you gain more benefits from taking a long
    rest. Instead of regaining half of your maximum amount of
    hit dice upon completing a long rest, you instead regain all
    of your hit dice.</ul>
<ul>◾
    As a bonus action, you can teleport to a space you can see
    within 30 feet. Once you use this property of the ring, you
    cannot use it again until you have completed a short or
    long rest.</ul>
<ul>◾
    You gain proficiency in Animal Handling checks. If you are
    already proficient in Animal Handling, your proficiency
    bonus is doubled for Animal Handling checks.</ul>
