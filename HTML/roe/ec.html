<h1>Ring of Elemental Chaos</h1>
<h3>Attunement to the Elemental Chaos grants you the ability to draw upon the elemental forces in unexpected ways. While attuned to this ring, you gain the following benefits:</h3>
<ul>
Upon completing a long rest, roll a d6. You gain a damage
resistance as determined by the Elemental Chaos table.
This resistance remains until the end of your next long
rest.</ul><ul>
When you hit a creature with an attack, that creature
takes an additional 1d8 damage of the type determined by
your daily roll on the Elemental Chaos table.</ul><ul>
When you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, the elemental
damage granted to your attacks backfires, and you take
1d8 damage of the type determined by your daily roll on
the Elemental Chaos table. This damage bypasses any
resistance or immunity you have to that damage type.</ul>
