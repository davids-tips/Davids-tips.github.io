    <title>Ring of the Ethereal</title>
<h1>Ring of the Ethereal</h1>
<body>Attunement to the Ethereal Plane grants you a limited ability to move into the Ethereal Plane or to see into it. While attuned to this ring, you gain the following benefits</body>
<ul>You gain resistance to necrotic damage.</ul>
<ul>
You can try to hide when you are only lightly obscured
from the creature you are hiding from.</ul>
<ul>
You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have a
racial trait that grants you darkvision, the range of your
darkvision extends to 120 feet if it is not already. In
addition, the darkvision granted by this ring also allows
you to see through magical darkness to the same distance.</ul>
<ul>
When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a
ranged attack, making the attack doesn't reveal your
position.</ul>
