<h1>Ring of Shadows</h1>
<h4>Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunment</h4>
<h3>Attunement to the dark energies of the Shadowfell causes your body, as well as any equipment you are carrying or wearing, to become more muted and gray in color. While attuned to this ring, you gain the following benefits: You gain resistance to necrotic damage. You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature you are hiding from. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range extends out to 120 feet. In addition, the darkvision granted by this ring also allows you to see through magical darkness to the same distance. When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged attack, making the attack doesn’t reveal your position.</h3>
