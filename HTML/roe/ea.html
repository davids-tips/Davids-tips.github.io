    <title>Ring of Elemental Air</title>
    <h1>Ring of Elemental Air</h1>
    <h4>Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement</h4>
    <h3>
    Attunement to the Elemental Plane of Air gives you the ability
    to control the flow of air immediately around you. While
    attuned to this ring, you gain the following benefits:
    </h3>
    <ul>◾
    When you fall, you can use your reaction to cause a strong
    blast of air to burst from the ring and slow your descent,
    reducing the damage by up to 30 points. If you reduce the
    damage to 0, you automatically land on your feet. Once
    you use this property of the ring, it cannot be used again
    until you have completed a short or long rest.</ul>
    <ul>◾You become naturally acclimated to high altitudes,
    including elevations above 20,000 feet.</ul>
    <ul>◾You can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed equal to
    your walking speed for 1 minute. Once you use this
    property of the ring, it cannot be used again until the next
    dawn.</ul>
    <ul>◾You can use an action to breathe fresh air directly from the
    ring, allowing you to take breaths while submerged in
    liquid, avoid using a limited supply of air in an enclosed
    environment, or avoid the negative effects of breathing air
    that would otherwise cause a poisonous or other toxic
    effect. You must use an action to breathe from the ring
    every time you wish to stop holding your breath in such an
    environment.</ul>
    <ul>◾You can use an action to create up to a moderate wind in a
    20 foot cone emanating from the ring in any direction you
    choose. The effect lasts for 1 round.
    </ul>
