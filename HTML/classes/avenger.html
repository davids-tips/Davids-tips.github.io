<h1>Avenger</h1>
<h3> As an avenger, you are an agent of divine justice, a deadly
weapon in the service of the gods. You might be the sworn
disciple of a single god, enforcing their will upon the world, or
perhaps you dedicate yourself to an entire pantheon, a heavensent executioner armed with righteous purpose.</h3>
<h2>Armour of faith</h2>
<h3>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your faith shields you from harm. While visibly wearing a holy symbol and not wearing armour or wielding a shield, your AC equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier (to a maximum of +2). </h3>
<h2>Crusader's Arm</h2>
<h3>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. In addition, you can use your Sneak Attack with any melee weapon, even if it isn't a finesse or ranged weapon.</h3>
<h2> Divine Judgment</h2> 
<h3>Beginning at 3rd level, you can swear an oath to end a life in the name of the gods. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For 10 minutes, the target is marked for divine judgement. The judgement ends early if you or the target dies, or if you choose to end it. Until the judgement ends, your attack rolls against the target can't have disadvantage, and you can use your Sneak Attack against the target even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the target is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you finish a short or long rest.</h3>
<h2>Celestial Shackles</h2>
<h3>Starting at 9th level, you are connected to the target of your Divine Judgement by an ethereal chain, which only you can see. Until the judgement ends, you always know the direction of and distance to the target, and it can't be hidden from you. Additionally, when the target of your judgement attempts to move away from you, teleport away from you, or travel to another plane, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus).. On a failed save, the target can't willingly do so until the start of its next turn. </h3>
<h2>Fated Strike</h2>
<h3>At 13th level, the will of the gods grant your every strike an impossible accuracy. You have advantage on attack rolls against the target of your Divine Judgement.</h3>
<h2>Shift Judgement</h2>
<h3>Also at 13th level, you learn to shift your Divine Judgement from one foe to a greater threat. As a bonus action, you can move your judgement to a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, ending the mark on the original target. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest</h3>
<h2>Nobile Duel</h2>
<h3>Starting at 17th level, none shall interfere with your hunt. For the duration of your Divine Judgement, you have resistance to all damage dealt by creatures other than the target of your judgement. Additionally, while moving directly towards the target of your Divine Judgement, you can move through the spaces of other creatures, and your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.</h3>
