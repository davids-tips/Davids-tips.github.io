<title>Grail of the Savior</title>
<h1>Grail of the Savior</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Common</h4>
<h3>This bronze grail smells faintly of grapes and is fairly heavy to the touch. Any water poured into the goblet is instantly transmuted into red wine. The quality of the wine depends on the quality of the water, with purer water giving better wine. The grail can transmute 2 quarts of water into wine each day, and it recharges at dawn.</h3>
