<h1>Common Magical Items Pricing</h1>
<h3>Common magic items can vary wildly in price depending on the setting, availability, and usefulness of the item. They should seldom cost more than 50 gold pieces, and the least useful (Paper of Purpling, Endless Chalk) can be priced as low as a few silver pieces each in high-magic settings.</h3>
