<h1>Penelope's Priners</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Common</h4>
<h3>A creature can speak the command word for this set of metal shears, and they will automatically begin trimming the nearest bush or hedge until it is tidy, at which point the shears will return to that creature at a speed of 10 feet per round if the creature is on the same plane of existence. If a creature does not use its action to catch them or is on a different plane of existence, the shears will fall to the ground, their task completed.</h3>
