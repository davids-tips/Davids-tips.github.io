<h1>Many Melodies' Box</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Common</h4>
<h3>A creature can speak the command word of this small, wooden box to store up to forty minutes of sound (Either all at once or in segments), which can then be played back by turning the hand crank on the side. Any sound other than music is omitted from the recording.</h3>
