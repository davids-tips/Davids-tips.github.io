<h1>Patch of Sticking</h1>
<h4>Wonderous Item-Common</h4>
<h3>This two-inch by two-inch patch can be applied to any solid or cloth surface as an action, and will affix itself to said surface as if it were sewn in place with a sturdy thread. Once it is removed (with any amount of slashing damage or a DC 8 Strength check), it loses its magic until the next dawn.</h3>
