<h1>Druidic Circle of the City </h1>
<h3>Within every city is the same air that lows through forests and above seas. All manner of lora and fauna call the streets, sewers, and rooftops their home; rats tunnel through walls, creeping moss blankets brick, birds lay nests, and bugs infest every corner. Pockets of nature endure nestled within civilization, and where nature goes, druids follow. Druids of the Circle of the City embody nature's quietp ersistence, preferring a subtle hand and quick eye in defense of their small, hidden sanctuaries. </h3>
<h2>Urban Jungles</h2>
<h3>At 2nd level, you effortlessly blend with the critters that make towns and cities their homes. You can transform into Tiny beasts with a challenge rating of 0 without expending a use  of your Wild Shape feature. Your druid level deturmines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the beast shapes table.</h3>

<h2>Circle Spells</h2>
<h3>Starting at 2nd level, your communion with the wild places and creatures within civilization allows you to cast certain spells, as shown on the Circle Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</h3>
