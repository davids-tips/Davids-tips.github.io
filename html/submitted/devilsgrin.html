<head>The Devil's Grin</head>
<desc>Wonderous Item-Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</desc>
<body>The off-putting nature of this mask only seems to be noticed when not being worn, causing most common folk who witness it to not give it a passing glance. For others, the odd sharpened silver teeth and tusks jetting out of the golden mouth give pause. The hairs on the back of the neck give rise, begging one to steer clear of this metal grin. The user must attune for the mask to be worn, the assembly having no straps or buckles. While attuned to and wearing this mask, you gain the following benefits: +2 Charisma score to a maximum of 20, the wearer gains the ability to read and write in Infernal, you gain proficiency in persuasion and deception, and if already proficient, you gain expertise. When worn through a long rest, the wearer has a 50% chance to grow a pair of Tiefling horns. If they already possess horns, they will double in length. If attunement is broken, the horns will wither and chip away, leaving scars to forever mark their presence.</body>
<bodyhead> CURSE</bodyhead>
<body>This magical item is cursed. After a week of attunement, whenever the user is offered a bargain or deal, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the user will agree to the deal/bargain on any terms, and strive relentlessly to complete without rest. This DC increases by 2 per week after being attuned, resetting on a failure. A full week passes before re-activating. Only a devil can remove this curse.</body>
